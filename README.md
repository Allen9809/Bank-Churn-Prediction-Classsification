# Bank Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
The Bank Churn Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take preventive measures to retain them. In this project, we analyze a dataset obtained from Kaggle containing information about bank customers, including their demographics, banking activities, and whether they churned or not.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

1. Data Exploration
In this phase, we explore the dataset to gain insights into the features, their distributions, and relationships with the target variable (churn). Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to understand the data better and identify any patterns or anomalies.

2. Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning models, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and possibly feature engineering to create new relevant features.

3. Model Training
Two main methods are employed for model training:

- Method 1: Select the Baseline Model, Fine-tune the Selected Model, then Evaluate it.
- Method 2: Fine-tune All Models, Select the Best One, and Evaluate it.

Several machine learning algorithms are considered for training, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. Each model is trained and optimized using appropriate techniques such as hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

4. Model Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, with a focus on maximizing the recall rate to detect as many potential churn customers as possible. Hold-out test sets are used to assess the generalization performance of the models.

5. Feature Interpretation
After selecting the best-performing model, feature interpretation techniques are applied to understand the importance of different features in predicting churn. This could involve examining built-in feature importance methods provided by the model or using libraries like SHAP for more advanced feature interpretation.

## Project Outcome
The primary goal of the project is to develop a robust machine learning model with high recall rate to accurately predict bank customer churn. The final model is deployed and can be used by the bank to identify customers at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them, thereby improving customer retention and business profitability.

## Repository Structure
The project repository follows a structured format with directories for data, notebooks, source code, trained models, and documentation. The README file provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, and instructions for replicating the analysis.

## Conclusion
The Bank Churn Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem. By accurately predicting customer churn, banks can take proactive steps to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction and profitability.
